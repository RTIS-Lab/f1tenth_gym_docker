This repository is a Docker setup for the [F1Tenth simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym), inspired by https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros. It makes the simulator controls available over ROS2, using topics similar to those found on the real car. By running in Docker, ROS2 installation is managed for you, and can be run on most Linux, Mac, or Windows systems.

Uses submodules, so clone using `--recurse-submodules.`. Some modules may be private - if so, they are not critical.
